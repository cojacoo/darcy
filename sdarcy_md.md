# Original Darcy

The original Darcy model is a macroscale Linear Flow equation 
for water flow through a saturated porous medium. In line with 
all linear flow equations, it states that the boundary fluxes ($Q$) of
a stationary system is the product of the saturated hydraulic 
conductivity ($K$, invert of its resistivity) and the pressure gradient 
($\Nabla H$).

$Q = K * \Nabla H$
